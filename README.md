`igata(é‹³åž‹)` is my boilerplate for Web Frontend. It should be maintained by me and my lovely Renovate bot as much as possible. By the way, `é‹³åž‹` is a Japanese word and it means a boilerplate or casting mold.

```exs
'boilerplate'
|> toJapanese // é‹³åž‹
|> toAlphabet // igata ðŸŽ‰
```

## DEMO

## How to use

Recommend to use as a template. Please click above ["Use this template"](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) button to start. Though the template function provided by GitHub is really comfort and useful, please note that your new repository is always created from HEAD of `master`.

About template for more information, see [Creating a repository from a template](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)

## How to build and launch server

```sh
$ yarn # npm install
$ yarn start # npm start

## Note

### Pre-commit tasks

Some tasks are kicked before committing by the combination of `husky` and `lint-staged`, but unfortunately they are **NOT** always called, so some developers may skip this check process as a result. As far as I know, some GUI git clients can ignore and skip the checking.
