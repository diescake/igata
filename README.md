`igata(é‹³åž‹)` is my boilerplate for Web Frontend. I and my lovely dependabot will continue to maintain its freshness as much as possible. Then, `é‹³åž‹` is a Japanese keyword and that means a boilerplate or casting mold.

## Note

### Pre-commit tasks

Some tasks are kicked before committing by the combination of `husky` and `lint-staged`, but unfortunately they are **NOT** always called and some developers will skip this check process as a result. As far as I know, some GUI git clients can penetrate it.
