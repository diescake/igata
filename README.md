`igata(é‹³åž‹)` is my boilerplate for Web Frontend. I and my lovely dependabot will continue to maintain its freshness as much as possible. Then, `é‹³åž‹` is a Japanese keyword and that means a boilerplate or casting mold.

## Note

### Pre-commit tasks

Some tasks are kicked before committing by the combination of `husky` and `lint-staged`, but unfortunately they are **NOT** always called and some developers will skip this check process as a result. As far as I know, some GUI git clients can penetrate it.

### [vscode-tslint](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-tslint) plugin problems

Currently, vscode-tslint plugin does not support several rules in tslint.yaml because it can not fetch type information in `tsconfig.json`. Unfortunately, it seems that maintainers have no plans to add support it. Therefore, even if your VSCode readies for running vscode-tslint in real-time, you should sometimes run `yarn lint` manually and confirm result.
